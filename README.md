# Credit Card Fraud Transaction Classification

This repo contains the credit card fraud transaction classification.

[Project Report can be downloaded here](https://github.com/latestcomment/credit-card-fraud/blob/main/Project%20Reports_%20Credit%20Card%20Transaction%20Fraud%20Detection.pdf)

The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying credit card transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. The model should balance the need for high detection rates with the minimization of false positives to ensure practical usability in real-world scenarios.

Models which considered in this project:
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- AdaBoost
